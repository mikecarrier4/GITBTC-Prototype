              <p><p>Crypto Markets Never Sleep</p>
              <p><a href="mailto:info@git-BTC.com"></a></p></p>
              <p> As my close friends' portfolios have grown with the commission-free options trading movement and crypto boom over the past five years, it has come to my attention that all of these portfolios carry significant systematic risks to the downside markets. Though not a replacement to standard portfolio management, this project aims to help stabilize portfolios through downtimes by giving a variety of technical trading options to the user to take advantage of day trading tactics without constantly monitoring their accounts.  And though most of my peers are hopelessly addicted to their mobile accounts, they still must, unfortunately, go to sleep at some point in the middle of the day and can miss significant moves in the options and crypto markets.  This loss of opportunity gains was the inspiration for this project. Though I am not the first person to ever construct a platform that day trades using technical analysis, I thought it would be helpful to integrate some of these methods with Robinhood accounts to accommodate the user better. Through the GIT-BTC project, one will gain access to technical trading strategies on options and crypto-assets that will allow one to leave trade execution and trade settlement to the platform.  I will declare here that it is not a 'money machine' or 'algorithm my friend constructed that never losses money' but rather an automated trade execution platform.  The user still needs to monitor markets carefully and understand what each strategy and asset is.  


                  Note on credentials - I do not persist your data anywhere on the site or backend.  When invited, you will be able to access and view a clone of the trading strategy layer of the code repository so you can verify the financial strategies.  For the time bieng , one will view perfomance using the Robinhood app.  All techincals for GTC-BTC comes from Taapi.com.  Trades are executed by Robinhood.
