              <p><p>Crypto Markets Never Sleep</p>
              <p><a href="mailto:info@git-BTC.com"></a></p></p>
              <p> As my close friends' portfolios have grown with the commission-free options trading movement and crypto boom over the past five years, it has come to my attention that most of these portfolios carry significant systematic risks to the downside markets. Though not a replacement to standard portfolio management, this project aims to help stabilize portfolios through downtimes by giving a variety of technical trading options to the user to take advantage of day trading tactics without constantly monitoring their accounts.  Though I am not the first person to ever construct a platform that day trades using technical analysis, I thought it would be helpful to integrate some of these methods with Robinhood accounts to accommodate the user. Through the GIT-BTC project, one will gain access to technical trading strategies on options and crypto-assets that will allow one to leave trade execution and trade settlement to the platform. I will declare here that it is not a 'money machine' or 'algorithm my friend constructed that never losses money' but rather an automated trade execution platform. Robinhood also does not provide the best trade execution prices, and serious traders should look for more professional venues.  The user still needs to monitor markets carefully and understand what each strategy and asset is. 
	 
	 
	 Note on credentials - I do not persist your data anywhere on the site or backend. When invited, you will be able to access and view a clone of the trading strategy layer of the code repository to verify the financial strategies. For the time being, one will view performance using the Robinhood app. All technicals for GTC-BTC come from Taapi.com. Trades are executed by Robinhood.
